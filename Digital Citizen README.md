# Prototypes-HTML
HTML wireframe files with useless code which are intended merely to display intended function of digiciti.org

This is the first round of mockups on the Digital Citizen project.

Will be adding most of the ongoing content here: https://github.com/DigiCiti/DigitalCitizen.

This project will require collaborators to view prototypes/wireframes to begin development.  They were created with Axure RP using fairly useless code.  They are viewable directly in browser.

Visit digiciti.org for information about this project.
